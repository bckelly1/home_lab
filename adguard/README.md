If you want to use AdGuard, this is a good starting point. You can spin it up yourself and it will run and you can configure it, or you can try using this template which will populate some of the basics for you.

The template is in `./config/AdGuardHome.yml`

I removed the users from it so it should prompt you for a new admin user. You can also just delete the file and spin everything up fresh.
