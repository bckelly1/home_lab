Repo Origin: https://github.com/ping/odmpy
There is no dedicated docker image, so I created a Dockerfile and built one myself. Overkill, wasteful and unnecessary but it's fine.

command to run:
python3 -m odmpy libby --keepcover --merge --settings ./config --ebooks -d ./MyLoans --bookfolderformat "%(Author)s" --bookfileformat "%(Title)s"
